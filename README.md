### Hi there 👋

I was former IT teacher in college. After nearly 6 years of staying out-of-IT-field, I decide to come back and I want to become a professional developer. Technique is changing everyday, therefore I am updating and upgrading my knowledge and skills currently.
- 🌱 Interested fields: Web Development, Data Analysis and Management.
- 😄 Technical use: 
-- Programing languages: HTML, CSS, SASS, vanilla javascript, TypeScript, Python, SQL, PHP (out of practice).
-- Library or framework: React (Hooks, Context, Router, React-Redux), Redux, Bootstrap5
- 👯 I’m looking for jobs related to data process and web development
